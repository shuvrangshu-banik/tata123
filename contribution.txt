<p>One of the earliest notable acquisitions was in 2000, when <b>Tata Tea (now Tata Consumer Products)</b> acquired Tetley, the world’s second-largest tea brand, for $450 million. This acquisition allowed Tata Tea to solidify its presence in international markets, particularly in the <u>UK and North America</u>, as it took advantage of Tetley’s established brand and distribution networks. This move reflected <u>Ratan Tata’s</u> long-term vision for expanding Tata Group’s global footprint.
</p>
<p>Another major milestone came in 2007 when Tata Steel acquired <b>Corus</b>, a leading European steel manufacturer, for $12.1 billion. This acquisition not only marked one of the largest deals in the steel industry at the time but also positioned <b>Tata Steel</b> as one of the top five steel producers globally. By gaining access to Corus’ advanced manufacturing technology and strong presence in Europe, Tata Steel enhanced its market competitiveness and technological capabilities, cementing its place as a key player in the global steel market.

<p>In 2008, Tata Motors made a bold move by acquiring <b>Jaguar and Land Rover</b> from Ford for $2.3 billion. At the time, both brands were struggling, but under Tata’s leadership, they were revitalized through substantial investments in new models and design. The acquisition allowed <b>Tata Motors</b> to enter the luxury car segment, adding to its portfolio and marking a major step in its global expansion. Ratan Tata's strategic vision not only saved the two iconic brands but also turned them into profitable ventures.

<p>That same year, <b>Tata Motors</b> also launched the <b>Tata Nano</b>, which was dubbed the world’s cheapest car at the time, priced around ₹100,000 (approximately $2,000). The Nano aimed to provide a safer and more affordable alternative to motorcycles for India’s vast lower-income population. Though the Nano faced challenges in sales, the car symbolized Ratan Tata’s commitment to affordable innovation and his vision to bring cars within the reach of the masses, especially in emerging markets.

<p>Additionally, Ratan Tata’s leadership saw Tata Motors introduce <b>the Tata Indica</b> in 1998, India’s first passenger car designed and developed entirely within the country. The Indica was a response to the growing demand for affordable cars in India and helped position Tata Motors as a key player in the Indian automotive market. The Indica’s success laid the foundation for Tata Motors’ further innovations and expansion.

The company’s expansion into global markets helped boost Tata Group’s revenues and solidified TCS as a major player in the IT and business services sector. TCS became one of the key drivers of Tata Group’s growth, showcasing Ratan Tata’s ability to diversify and innovate across industries.
